# Predicting Air Quality Levels Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict air quality index (AQI) levels using advanced machine learning algorithms to gain insights into environmental conditions and pollution trends.

## Project Overview
Air pollution poses serious health risks and environmental concerns. This project develops a predictive model using historical air quality and meteorological data to forecast AQI levels. The insights can help policymakers, environmental agencies, and the public take informed actions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and EDA
- Training models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Evaluation using RMSE and R² metrics
- Visualizing prediction results

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries with pip
2. Run `source_code.py`
3. View model performance and visual outputs
